# LibreArp Changelog

## Versioning

LibreArp's versioning pattern is as follows:

`LibreArp <feature>.<hotfix>[-testing<testno>]`

* `feature` is incremented with each release containing new features and fixes
* `hotfix` is incremented with each release containing only fixes
* the `testing` string is appended to experimental versions of releases
* `testno` is the number of the testing version, should there be more than one

### Examples of versions

* `LibreArp 1.0` - The initial stable release version
* `LibreArp 1.1` - Stable release version containing fixes for `LibreArp 1.0`
* `LibreArp 3.0-testing1` - The first experimental version for `LibreArp 3.0`
* `LibreArp 3.0-testing2` - The second experimental version for `LibreArp 3.0`
